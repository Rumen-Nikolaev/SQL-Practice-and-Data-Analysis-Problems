## Tasks and Solutions

1. **Car Rental Cost Calculation**
   - **Task:** A car rental company charges a flat fee of $50 per day plus $0.20 per mile driven. If a customer rents a car for 3 days and drives 250 miles, how much will the total cost be?
   - **Solution:** 
     ```
     Total Cost = Flat Fee + (Cost per Mile * Miles Driven)
                = (50 * 3) + (0.20 * 250)
                = 150 + 50
                = $200
     ```

2. **Rectangle Dimensions**
   - **Task:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 cm, find the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Perimeter = 2(L + W)
     Let W = width, L = 2W
     48 = 2(2W + W)
     48 = 6W
     W = 8 cm
     L = 16 cm
     ```

3. **Election Vote Distribution**
   - **Task:** In a school election, a candidate receives 55% of the votes, while the other candidate receives 35%. The remaining 10% of the votes were invalid. If there were 1,000 votes in total, how many valid votes did each candidate receive?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Total Valid Votes = 1000 - (10% of 1000) = 900
     Candidate 1 Votes = 55% of 900 = 495
     Candidate 2 Votes = 35% of 900 = 315
     ```

4. **Investment Growth Calculation**
   - **Task:** A person invests $5,000 in a bank account with an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded annually. How much money will be in the account after 5 years?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
     A = 5000(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*5) 
     A = 5000(1.04)^5 
     A ≈ $6,083.20
     ```

5. **Train Meeting Time Calculation**
   - **Task:** Two trains start from different cities and head toward each other. One train is traveling at 80 km/h, and the other at 100 km/h. If the cities are 540 km apart, how long will it take for the trains to meet?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Combined Speed = 80 + 100 = 180 km/h
     Time = Distance / Speed = 540 / 180 = 3 hours
     ```

6. **Package Transport Calculation**
   - **Task:** A company needs to transport 120 packages. A small van can carry 15 packages at a time, while a large truck can carry 30 packages at a time. If they have 3 vans and 2 trucks, how many trips will each vehicle need to make to transport all the packages?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Packages by Vans = 3 * 15 = 45
     Packages by Trucks = 2 * 30 = 60
     Total = 105 packages transported
     Remaining = 120 - 105 = 15
     Additional trip needed by a van for 15 packages.
     ```

7. **Temperature Drop Calculation**
   - **Task:** The temperature dropped 5°C per hour for 6 hours, starting from 20°C. What was the temperature after the 6 hours?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Temperature Drop = 5 * 6 = 30°C
     Final Temperature = 20°C - 30°C = -10°C
     ```

8. **Price Change Calculation**
   - **Task:** A store increases the price of a product by 10%, then applies a 15% discount on the new price. What is the overall percentage change in the price?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Original Price = P
     Increased Price = P * 1.10 = 1.1P
     Discounted Price = 1.1P * 0.85 = 0.935P
     Overall Change = (0.935P - P) / P * 100 ≈ -6.5%
     ```

9. **Marble Selection Probability**
   - **Task:** A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If you randomly select two marbles, what is the probability that both are blue?
   - **Solution:**
     ```
     Total Marbles = 10
     Probability of First Blue = 3/10
     Probability of Second Blue = 2/9
     P(Both Blue) = (3/10) * (2/9) = 1/15
     ```

10. **Running Time Calculation**
    - **Task:** A runner completes a 400-meter lap in 60 seconds. If they maintain the same pace, how long will it take them to run 5 kilometers (5,000 meters)?
    - **Solution:**
      ```
      Time for 1 Lap = 60 seconds
      Laps in 5 km = 5000 / 400 = 12.5 laps
      Total Time = 12.5 * 60 = 750 seconds ≈ 12 minutes 30 seconds
      ```
